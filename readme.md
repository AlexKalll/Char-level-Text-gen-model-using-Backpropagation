# Amharic Character-Level Text Generator (From Scratch)

This project implements a simple character-level RNN text generator from scratch using only NumPy. It learns to generate Amharic text based on a custom dataset.

## Features
- Pure NumPy (no deep learning frameworks)
- Manual backpropagation and training loop
- Supports Amharic character filtering and encoding
- Text sampling for generation

## Usage
1. Upload your Amharic dataset to Google Drive.
2. Run the Colab notebook or script.
3. The model trains on a subset of the dataset and periodically samples generated Amharic text.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Google Colab (for Drive support)

## Output
Generates Amharic text character-by-character based on learned patterns.
